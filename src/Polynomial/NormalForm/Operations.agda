-- The reason the following code is so verbose is termination
-- checking. For instance, in the third case for ⊞-coeffs, we call a
-- helper function. Instead, you could conceivably use a with-block
-- (on ℕ.compare p q):
--
-- ⊞-coeffs ((x , p) ∷ xs) ((y , q) ∷ ys) with (ℕ.compare p q)
-- ... | ℕ.less    p k = (x , p) ∷ ⊞-coeffs xs ((y , k) ∷ ys)
-- ... | ℕ.equal   p   = (fst~ x ⊞ fst~ y , p) ∷↓ ⊞-coeffs xs ys
-- ... | ℕ.greater q k = (y , q) ∷ ⊞-coeffs ((x , k) ∷ xs) ys
--
-- However, because the first and third recursive calls each rewrap
-- a list that was already pattern-matched on, the recursive call
-- does not strictly decrease the size of its argument.
--
-- Interestingly, if --without-K is turned off, we don't need the
-- helper function ⊞-coeffs; we could pattern match on _⊞_ directly.

-- _⊞_ {zero} (lift x) (lift y) = lift (x + y)
